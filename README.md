# alpha-cal-js
JavaScript was used to speed up data entry and calendaring in an existing database front end (Alpha Five / SQL Server). 
Existing fields required manual calculation and typing. 
The instructions had to be memorized or found in a separate location. 
The JavaScript addition saved time, reduced errors, and allowed new users to easily learn the system.
